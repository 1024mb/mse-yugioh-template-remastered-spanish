Yu-Gi-Oh! Complete Package template for Magic Set Editor reworked in HD and Spanish.

Currently some graphics are kinda low quality, I'm in the process of reworking or searching for others with better quality. I've replaced several ones with better quality ones which should improve graphics.  
Also, MSE will now export the custom cards at 697x1016 at 300dpi.

When I've been translating the English strings into Spanish I've encountered some errors in the original formatting of the template which I've fixed. Well, I've edited almost everything about sizes so I had to fixed them when I was reworking that.  
There is currently at least one string (iirc) that I couldn't translate: "card". Yeah, that string that appears in the Random Decks tab, I don't know if is possible to translate that string because the little effort I put into changing it for "carta" didn't give any good results so I would have to look into it more deeply but that would be when I finish reworking the other templates.

Credits for the original work to UnknownGuest, the0nlykyd, Art_Freak, and the others which I couldn't find information of.

If I find the time I will translate this readme into Spanish, I'm lazy af :grin:.
