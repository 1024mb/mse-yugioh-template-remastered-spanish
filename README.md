Yu-Gi-Oh! Complete Package template for Magic Set Editor reworked in HD and Spanish.

Currently some graphics are kinda low quality, I'm in the process of reworking or searching for others with better quality. I've replaced several ones with better quality ones which should improve graphics.  
Also, MSE will now export the custom cards at 697x1016 which at 300dpi is 59mm x 86mm.

When I have been translating the English strings into Spanish I've encountered some errors in the original formatting of the template which I've fixed. Well, I've edited almost everything about sizes so I had to fix them when I was reworking that.  
There is currently at least one string (iirc) that I couldn't translate: "card".  
Yeah, that string that appears in the Random Decks tab, I don't know if is possible to translate that string because the little effort I put into changing it for "carta" didn't give any good results so I would have to look into it more deeply but that would be when I finish reworking the other card templates.  
<small>Update:</small> Upon some tiny... well I don't know if I can call it research but lets do it, I may have found that the only way of translating that is to change the source code of MSE, still will have to look into that more.

One complain tho, MSE is painful to work with when creating templates. I want to see if everything fits meticulously well but if one sets zoom to 200% you CAN'T see the bottom part of the card (it all depends on your resolution also, but with 1080p it was painful so...), I had to use my hawk vision to see if everything fit properly because exporting the cards as images was also SO damn tedious, I had to work with 90% zoom for the middle-bottom parts.

## Currently updated/reworked templates:

- Standard
- Standard Pendulum

## Unfinished templates (Either I'm still working on them or I haven't started yet):

- Standard Extra
- Comic
- TV Show
- Bandai
- Evolution
- Zotoshi
- CBG Style

Credits for the original work to UnknownGuest, the0nlykyd, Art_Freak, and the others which I couldn't find information of.

If I find the time I will translate this readme into Spanish, I'm lazy af :grin:.

## Known Glitches <small>(yeah, you read it right)</small>

- It's better to set zoom to 90% so the full card can be seen while editing.
- Levels (Stars, Spell/Trap type icons) may be shown by MSE as if they were very close to each other (this is more notorious with Stars because you usually add more than just one). Don't mind this, they are with the correct separation, if you want to see how the card will really look you have to set the zoom to 200% or just export the card and zoom the exported PNG with your favorite viewer.
- Words are not splitting when they are too large to fit in the same line, instead the whole word is being pushed to the next line and a big empty space is left. I haven't looked much into this so I don't know if it can be fixed or if it's hard-coded into MSE so in the mean time you should separate the words manually with an space.
